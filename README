BicaVM
======

This project is an implementation of a JVM in JavaScript. At this
moment it runs Java Code but is more like a proof of concept than a
real JVM. Alot of work is required to make this JVM to run java code
(including writting an entire runtime enviroment).

Installation
============

1. Checkout the code from github
2. make - A webserver will start
3. Point the latest version of chrome to http://0.0.0.0:8080/

What can/can't do at this point
==========================

BicaVM can interpret a big chunck of JVM's bytecode, probably around
60%. However is wildy incomplete. It has a JNI interface that maps to
JavaScript functions. It has no JIT compilation.
